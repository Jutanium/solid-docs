# Support

We would love contributions to our documentation. Writing clear, concise and easy to translate documentation for a project like Solid can be tricky. It takes a community to make this possible. We encourage you to submit translations and edits as PRs. Translations for Indonesian, Russian, German and Japanese would be especially nice!

To start a translation project, create a folder with the language code in the root of the project and copy English docs from the en folder. File structures must be maintained and content should be a direct translation without additions or modification of the original material. Kindly submit your contributions as PRs. A Solid team member and other native speakers of your language will have an opportunity to review your work before it's merged into the main branch.

If you feel the documentation is missing any important detail, please feel free to open an issue or submit a modifying PR.

# Thank You
